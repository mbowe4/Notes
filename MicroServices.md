# MicroServices
* Distributed, loosley coupled software services taht carry out a small number of well-defined tasks
* Allow you to take a large application and decompose it into easy-to-manage components with narrowly defined responsibilities.
* Decompose the large code base down into small well-defined pieces

#### Microservice Architecture:

#### Characteristics:
* Application logic is broken down into small componenents
* Communicate based on lightweight protocols such as HTTP, JSON for exchanging data between service consumer and service provider
* Commuicate with technology-neutral protocol

#### Why Spring is relevant to Microservices:
* Spring allows you to more easily manage large Java projects by externalizing the relationship between objects through annotations rather than hard-coded knowledge about each other (it manages their dependencies)

#### Spring Cloud
* Makes it simple to operationalize
