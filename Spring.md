## Spring
* model: where the data is held (mysql, xml, csv)
* view: what the client sees (ionic app running typescript)
* controller: Spring App: middleware

- ionic = platform to create end product
	- creates a project in the native language (android, swift, xcode)
	- transpiles from typescript to any language
- webapp made in Angular

## Ionic vs. Angular
* Angular = web-based
* Angular came out with a framework for a single-page app. It loads one page then swaps content
* Ionic w/Cordova = plugins and templates for apps
	* take advantage of native features on mobile devices
